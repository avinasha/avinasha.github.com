<p>I always have been a hater of poems and anything Shakespearean. When I heard the next Write-Club meetup is all about poems, I considered skipping it. But I ended up at the meetup and braved myself for a boring session. I couldn't have been more wrong.</p>&#13;
<p>The session was all about poems; <strong>poems which are fun to write!</strong> We started out with a form of poetry called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrostic" title="Acrostic" target="_blank">Acrostic</a> poems</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>An <strong>acrostic</strong> is a poem or other form of writing in which the first letter, syllable or word of each line, paragraph or other recurring feature in the text spells out a word or a message.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>We were each given a picture for which we have to assign a theme and construct an acrostic poem around it. I got an image of a sunset and this is what I could come up with <em><strong>(Warning: These are my first poems)</strong></em></p>&#13;
<p>Theme from the image: <strong>THE FIERY SKY</strong></p>&#13;
<p><em><strong>T</strong>he sun dropped down the horizon</em></p>&#13;
<p><em><strong>H</strong>esitant to leave behind his beloved sky</em></p>&#13;
<p><em><strong>E</strong>nraged to be conquered by the silent moon</em></p>&#13;
<p><em><br /></em></p>&#13;
<p><em><strong>F</strong>reeze! ordered the sun</em></p>&#13;
<p><em><strong>I</strong> am the king of the sky</em></p>&#13;
<p><em><strong>E</strong>arth gave no heed and continued on</em></p>&#13;
<p><em><strong>R</strong>aged, the sun lashed out</em></p>&#13;
<p><em><strong>Y</strong>ellow went the sky</em></p>&#13;
<p><em><br /></em></p>&#13;
<p><em><strong>S</strong>urrendered, the sun at last</em></p>&#13;
<p><em><strong>K</strong>neeling to the nature's feet</em></p>&#13;
<p><em><strong>Y</strong>ellow then turned to black</em></p>&#13;
<p><em><br /></em></p>&#13;
<p>The second part of the session was even more interesting. We were thrown into a difficult world of <strong>Shape poems</strong>. Poems which conform to a particular shape in structure and in meaning. For example, if the shape is a triangle then the writing should start in a negative mood and end in the positive.</p>&#13;
<p>The first poem is a single narrative. I hope the shape is apparent.</p>&#13;
<p>                       <em>I laughed aloud, This is easy</em></p>&#13;
<p><em>                       I ran up the mountain</em></p>&#13;
<p><em>                       Had my first fall</em></p>&#13;
<p><em>                       It hurt bad</em></p>&#13;
<p><em>                       Pain</em></p>&#13;
<p><em>                    Blood   </em></p>&#13;
<p><em>                Fear to fail</em></p>&#13;
<p><em>             Evil Cruel smile</em></p>&#13;
<p><em>       On the mountain's face</em></p>&#13;
<p><em>Dejected, I bowed to the mighty</em></p>&#13;
<p><em><br /></em></p>&#13;
<p>The second poem is a two narrative. My poem is from the perspective of the good and the bad in the same person. Read each vertical half separately.</p>&#13;
<p><em>He                                    I</em></p>&#13;
<p><em> Is in                              am in</em></p>&#13;
<p><em> trouble                         trouble</em></p>&#13;
<p><em> Find solution               Find solution</em></p>&#13;
<p><em>  As soon as possible   As soon as possible</em></p>&#13;
<p><em>  We both must survive, here and now</em></p>&#13;
<p><em>  We are all but one    I need him to feed</em></p>&#13;
<p><em> In symphony           All I built in vain</em></p>&#13;
<p><em> We live                      If I die now</em></p>&#13;
<p><em>Forever                          in pain</em></p>&#13;
<p><em>Once                               ends</em></p>&#13;
<p>I never thought that I would one day write a poem. Hope you enjoyed these. Critics always welcome :D</p>
